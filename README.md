# Gorod-Krovi-Valve-Step-Solver
A simple code I made to solve the Easter Egg step on Gorod Krovi, from Black Ops 3.

Just run this code in any Java IDE.
To choose which valves are the starting and ending points, simply change the values in the solve method under the main method in the Solver class.
